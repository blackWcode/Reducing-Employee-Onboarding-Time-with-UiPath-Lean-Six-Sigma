🧑‍💼 HR Onboarding Process Improvement – Automation, Lean, and Analytics

This project simulates a complex HR onboarding process for a growing tech company and demonstrates how automation, data analysis, and Lean thinking can dramatically reduce inefficiencies, errors, and delays.

 🏢 Project Context

**FuturaCore Ltd.** is a mid-sized tech company with 600+ employees in Dublin, Cork, and Limerick. Their HR department manually handles new hire onboarding using emails, Excel trackers, and shared folders. Each onboarding process involves 8–10 repetitive steps and takes an average of **1 hour and 30 minutes per employee**.

The high volume of new hires and the use of **multiple HR officers** working across disconnected tools has led to:
- Inconsistent task tracking
- Frequent delays and errors
- Lack of visibility into overall onboarding performance

---

 🎯 Project Goals

This project aims to:
- **Map the current onboarding process** using Lean tools
- **Analyze a large, realistic HR dataset** with over 600 records
- **Automate key tasks** using UiPath, reducing manual load
- **Identify trends and bottlenecks** using Python
- **Showcase improvements** through visualizations and KPIs

---

 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – data analysis & insights  
- **UiPath** – workflow automation (emails, folders, status updates)  
- **Excel** – raw data entry and tracking  
- **Power BI / Canva** – dashboards and visual storytelling
