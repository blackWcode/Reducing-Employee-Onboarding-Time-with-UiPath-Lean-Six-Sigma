# 🧑‍💼 HR Onboarding Process Improvement  
### 🛠 Automation • 📊 Data Analysis • ♻️ Lean Six Sigma

This project simulates a complex HR onboarding process for a growing tech company and demonstrates how automation, data analysis, and Lean thinking can dramatically reduce inefficiencies, errors, and delays.

---
🏢 Business Context

FuturaCore manually manages onboarding across 3 locations. The average time is 90+ minutes per hire, with frequent errors and no centralised tracking.

This project applies:
- **Lean Six Sigma (DMAIC)** to structure improvements  
- **Python** for data cleaning and analysis  
- **UiPath** for automation (emails, folders, Excel)  
- **Power BI** for real-time dashboard reporting

## 🎯 Expected Results

| Metric               | Before       | Target       |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Onboarding Time      | 90+ mins     | < 45 mins    |
| Task Automation      | 0%           | ≥ 50%        |
| Manual Error Rate    | ~15%         | < 5%         |
| Dashboards & KPIs    | None         | Live & Real-time |

## 🧠 Key Insights & Visuals

### 📊 Correlation Between Delays in Onboarding Steps  
![Correlation Heatmap](./Correlation%20Between%20Delays%20in%20Onboarding%20Steps.png)  

> Weak correlations suggest that delays are **isolated by task**, not systemic — ideal for **targeted automation** per step.

### 📈 Distribution of Processing Time  
![Processing Time Histogram](./Distribution%20of%20Processing%20Time.png)  

> - Most onboarding times are between **75–105 minutes**  
> - Average: **~90 minutes**  
> - A few extreme cases exceed **150 minutes**, likely due to **manual delays**  
> - Highlights need for **cycle time reduction & process control**


## 🏢 Project Context

**FuturaCore Ltd.** is a mid-sized tech company with 600+ employees across Dublin, Cork, and Limerick. The HR department manages new hire onboarding manually using emails, Excel trackers, and shared folders. Each onboarding process involves 8–10 steps and takes an average of **1 hour and 30 minutes per employee**.

Key challenges:
- Inconsistent task tracking across HR officers  
- Frequent delays and data entry errors  
- Lack of visibility and standardisation in onboarding performance

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project aims to:
- 🔍 **Map** the current onboarding process using Lean tools  
- 🧠 **Analyze** a large, realistic HR dataset (600+ records)  
- 🤖 **Automate** repetitive tasks with UiPath to reduce manual effort  
- 📊 **Identify** trends, delays, and bottlenecks using Python  
- 📈 **Showcase** improvements through dashboards and KPIs  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Data cleaning, EDA (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **UiPath** – RPA workflow automation (email, folder setup, Excel updates)  
- **Excel** – Manual data simulation and tracking  
- **Power BI** – Data visualisation and performance dashboards  
- **Lean Six Sigma** – DMAIC methodology, SIPOC, process analysis  

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **File:** `realistic_hr_onboarding_data.xlsx`  
- **Size:** 600+ onboarding events across 3 office locations  
- **Fields Tracked:**
  - Offer Letter  
  - Document Collection  
  - Reference Checks  
  - Policy Distribution  
  - Vetting  
  - Contract Generation  
  - Folder Creation  
  - Final Confirmation Email  
- Additional Fields:
  - HR Officer Assigned  
  - Processing Time (in minutes)  
  - Delay Reasons  
  - Simulated Manual Entry Errors (typos, inconsistencies)

---

## 🧪 Python Notebook

- **File:** `hr_onboarding_analysis.ipynb`  
- **Includes:**
  - Data cleaning & transformation  
  - Processing time visualisation  
  - Completion rate analysis by step  
  - Delay heatmap  
  - Insights grouped by office and HR officer  

---

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- Which steps are most delay-prone or error-prone?  
- Which departments or locations experience longer onboarding times?  
- How do onboarding performance and consistency vary by HR officer?  
- How much time can automation realistically save?

---

## ✅ My Tasks & Contributions

### 1. Process Analysis Using DMAIC  
- Defined core onboarding issues using Lean Six Sigma  
- Measured delays and processing times from 600+ onboarding records  
- Analyzed high-error steps and inconsistent HR handling  
- Proposed automation and checklist-based standardisation  
- Created KPIs and control dashboards for long-term monitoring  

### 2. Data Analysis & Cleaning with Python  
- Identified and corrected missing values, typos, and inconsistencies  
- Created visual insights (distributions, heatmaps, bar charts)  
- Grouped and compared metrics by office, department, and officer  

### 3. Process Design Document (PDD)  
- Documented current and proposed onboarding workflows  
- Defined triggers, inputs/outputs, exceptions, and automation logic  
- Created clear before/after process maps for automation implementation  

### 4. Dashboard Design  
- Developed Power BI dashboard to track:
  - Completion rate by HR officer  
  - Step-level delay counts  
  - Average time saved post-automation  
  - Automation ROI metrics (before: 90 min → after: 45 min)
