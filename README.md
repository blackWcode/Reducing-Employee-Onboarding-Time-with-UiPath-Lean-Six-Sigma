🧑‍💼 HR Onboarding Process Improvement – Automation, Lean, and Analytics

This project simulates a complex HR onboarding process for a growing tech company and demonstrates how automation, data analysis, and Lean thinking can dramatically reduce inefficiencies, errors, and delays.

---

 🏢 Project Context

**FuturaCore Ltd.** is a mid-sized tech company with 600+ employees in Dublin, Cork, and Limerick. Their HR department manually handles new hire onboarding using emails, Excel trackers, and shared folders. Each onboarding process involves 8–10 repetitive steps and takes an average of **1 hour and 30 minutes per employee**.

The high volume of new hires and the use of **multiple HR officers** working across disconnected tools has led to:
- Inconsistent task tracking
- Frequent delays and errors
- Lack of visibility into overall onboarding performance

---

 🎯 Project Goals

This project aims to:
- **Map the current onboarding process** using Lean tools
- **Analyse a large, realistic HR dataset** with over 600 records
- **Automate key tasks** using UiPath, reducing manual load
- **Identify trends and bottlenecks** using Python
- **Showcase improvements** through visualizations and KPIs

---

 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – data analysis & insights  
- **UiPath** – workflow automation (emails, folders, status updates)  
- **Excel** – raw data entry and tracking  
- **Power BI – dashboards and visual storytelling  
- **Lean Six Sigma** – process mapping and before/after evaluation

📊 Dataset Overview

File: realistic_hr_onboarding_data 
Records: 600 onboarding events across 3 office locations

Tracked Steps:
- Offer Letter Email  
- Document Collection  
- Reference Verification  
- Policy & Forms Distribution  
- Vetting Process  
- Contract Generation  
- Folder Setup  
- Final Confirmation Email

Additional Features:
- HR officer assigned  
- Processing time in minutes  
- Delays and errors (with reasons)  
- Manual data entry inconsistencies simulated

🔥 Python notebook
 File: hr_onboarding_analysis.ipynb
It includes:

Data cleaning

Processing time visualisation

Step-level completion analysis

Delay heatmap

Grouped insights by office
---

🔍 Key Questions Explored

- Which departments or offices have the longest onboarding times?
- What steps are most commonly delayed or error-prone?
- How consistent are HR officers in completing tasks?
- How much time could be saved with automation?

---

 🧪 Project Outcomes

- Reduced average onboarding time by automating folder creation and confirmation emails  
- Identified key failure points (e.g., policy distribution & document collection)  
- Created visual process maps for before/after automation  
- Developed KPI visualisations for HR performance tracking

 ✅ My Tasks & Contributions

1. Process Analysis Using DMAIC
(Lean Six Sigma Foundation)

Define the current HR onboarding pain points (manual tasks, multiple HR officers, delays)

Measure using your generated dataset (processing time, delays per step)

Analyse root causes of errors and inefficiencies

Improve with proposed automation and standardisation

Control by implementing KPIs and tracking via a  dashboard


2. Data Analysis & Cleaning Using Python


Handle missing data, name typos, and inconsistencies across HR officers

Create grouped insights (e.g., avg time per step, per office, or per HR officer)

Build visual insights using Seaborn or Matplotlib (e.g., heatmaps, bar charts, timelines)

3. Create a PDD (Process Design Document)


Clearly outline the current manual process vs. the automated UiPath design

List actors, triggers, exceptions, inputs/outputs

Include before/after process diagrams
Pro Tip: This is highly valued in real RPA projects — shows you think like a process engineer

4. Create a Dashboard to Track HR Progress

Use Power BI (or Excel) to track:

Completion rate by HR officer

Step-by-step delay counts

Average time saved post-automation

Include slicers for office, department, or month

Add automation impact KPI: "Avg processing time before: 90 min → After: 45 min"
