## 👩🏾‍💼 HR Onboarding Process Improvement  
 
### 🛠 Automation • 📊 Data Analysis • ♻️ Lean Six Sigma

This project simulates a complex HR onboarding process for a growing tech company and demonstrates how automation, data analysis, and Lean thinking can dramatically reduce inefficiencies, errors, and delays.

---

## 🏢 Project Context

**FuturaCore Ltd.** is a mid-sized tech company with 600+ employees across Dublin, Cork, and Limerick. The HR department manages onboarding manually using emails, Excel trackers, and shared folders. Each onboarding takes an average of **1 hour and 30 minutes per employee**.

**Challenges:**
- Inconsistent task tracking  
- Frequent delays and data entry errors  
- No centralised visibility

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 🔍 Map the current process using Lean tools  
- 🧠 Analyze a realistic HR dataset (600+ records)  
- 🤖 Automate repetitive steps with UiPath  
- 📊 Identify trends and bottlenecks using Python  
- 📈 Showcase improvements with Power BI dashboards

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Data cleaning, EDA (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **UiPath** – RPA workflow automation  
- **Excel** – Manual data simulation and tracking  
- **Power BI** – Real-time dashboard visualization  
- **Lean Six Sigma** – DMAIC, SIPOC, process improvement

## 📈 Expected Results

| Metric               | Before       | Target       |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Onboarding Time      | 90+ mins     | < 45 mins    |
| Task Automation      | 0%           | ≥ 50%        |
| Manual Error Rate    | ~15%         | < 5%         |
| Dashboards & KPIs    | None         | Live tracking |

## 📊 Key Insights & Visuals

### 🔗 Correlation Between Delays in Onboarding Steps  
![Correlation Heatmap](./Correlation%20Between%20Delays%20in%20Onboarding%20Steps.png)  
> Weak correlations suggest delays are isolated by task, which is ideal for targeted automation.

### 🕒 Distribution of Processing Time  
![Processing Time Histogram](./Distribution%20of%20Processing%20Time.png)  
> Most onboarding takes **75–105 mins**, averaging ~90. A few cases exceed **150 mins**, showing opportunities for process control.
